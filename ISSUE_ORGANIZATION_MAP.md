## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus:** Core infrastructure

```
Week 1-2: Foundation
â”œâ”€â”€ #03 ZoneService Parsing      [MEDIUM] âš¡ Start here
â”œâ”€â”€ #01 TilemapRenderSystem       [HIGH]   ðŸ”¥ Parallel work
â””â”€â”€ #02 Collision Strategy        [HIGH]   ðŸ”¥ Parallel work
```

**Deliverables:**
- Zone files can be parsed with tilemap data
- Basic tilemap rendering works
- Collision strategy decided and documented

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus:** Essential gameplay features

```
Week 3-4: Core Features
â”œâ”€â”€ #12 Tilemap Collision         [HIGH]   ðŸ”¥ Depends on #03, #02
â”œâ”€â”€ #04 Real Zone Asset           [MEDIUM] Depends on #03
â”œâ”€â”€ #07 Trigger Conditions        [HIGH]   ðŸ”¥ Independent
â””â”€â”€ #11 Render Integration        [MEDIUM] Depends on #01
```

**Deliverables:**
- Collision working with tilemaps
- At least one complete zone asset
- ON_ENTER_AREA and ON_INTERACT triggers work
- Tilemaps render with entities in correct order

### Phase 3: Enhanced Functionality (Weeks 5-6)
**Focus:** Sequence system improvements

```
Week 5-6: Enhanced Functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ #08 Blocking Operation Completion  [MEDIUM]
â””â”€â”€ #09 Expand GameEvent Types         [MEDIUM]
```

**Deliverables:**
- Robust blocking operation handling
- New event types for richer sequences

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 7+)
**Focus:** Quality and performance

```
Week 7+: Polish
â”œâ”€â”€ #06 Tests & Quality           [LOW]
â”œâ”€â”€ #05 Typed UI Events           [LOW]  (optional)
â””â”€â”€ #10 Async Zone Loading        [LOW]
```

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Improved type safety (if #05 pursued)
- Smooth zone transitions

## Recommended Team Assignment

Based on expertise areas:

### Rendering Team
- **Primary:** #01, #11
- **Secondary:** #04 (asset creation)

### Gameplay/Systems Team
- **Primary:** #07, #08, #09
- **Secondary:** #03 (data model understanding)

### Physics/Collision Team
- **Primary:** #02, #12
- **Secondary:** #03 (tilemap data structure)

### Tools/Pipeline Team
- **Primary:** #03, #04
- **Secondary:** #10 (async loading)

### QA/Testing Team

- Issues: #01, #02, #03, #12
- **Goal:** Basic tilemap rendering and collision working

### v1.1 - Enhanced Triggers & Complete Zone
**Target:** 2-3 weeks after v1.0
- Issues: #04, #07, #11
- **Goal:** Full zone experience with spatial triggers

### v1.2 - Sequence Expansion
**Target:** 2 weeks after v1.1
- Issues: #08, #09
- **Goal:** Richer cutscene capabilities

### v2.0 - Polish & Performance
**Target:** Ongoing
- Issues: #05, #06, #10
- **Goal:** Production-ready quality

## Critical Path

The shortest path to a working tilemap system:

```
Critical Path (4-5 weeks):
1. #03 ZoneService Parsing       (1 week)
2. #01 TilemapRenderSystem        (1.5 weeks)
3. #02 Collision Strategy         (0.5 weeks - decision)
4. #12 Tilemap Collision          (1 week)
5. #04 Real Zone Asset            (0.5 weeks)
6. #11 Render Integration         (0.5 weeks)

Total: 5 weeks (with some parallelization: 4 weeks)
```

## Notes

- ðŸ”¥ = High priority
- âš¡ = Start immediately
- * = Related/supporting issue
- Weeks are estimates; adjust based on team size and velocity
- Some issues can be worked on in parallel
- Testing (#06) should be ongoing, not just at the end
