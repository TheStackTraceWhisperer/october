# README: GitHub Issues from TODO Documents

This package contains everything needed to convert TODO documents into well-organized GitHub issues for the October project.

## üìã What's Included

This conversion package provides multiple ways to create 12 organized GitHub issues from TODO documents:

### Source Documents
- `integration-todos.md` - Integration tasks and completed items
- `docs/zone-tilemap-sequence.md` - Architecture documentation with future enhancements

### Ready-to-Use Files
1. **Automated Script** - One-command issue creation
2. **Issue Templates** - 12 pre-formatted markdown files
3. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and organization maps

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Just want to create the issues?**

```bash
./create-issues-from-todos.sh
```

That's it! All 12 issues will be created in GitHub.

**Need more control?** See `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` for detailed options.

## üéØ Choose Your Method

### Method 1: Automated (Fastest)
**Best for:** Creating all issues at once

1. Ensure GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
2. Run `./create-issues-from-todos.sh`
3. Done!

**Time:** ~30 seconds

### Method 2: Manual (Full Control)
**Best for:** Reviewing and customizing each issue

1. Open `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES_FROM_TODOS/README.md`
2. For each issue template:
   - Copy content (excluding YAML frontmatter)
   - Paste into GitHub's new issue form
   - Add labels from frontmatter
3. Submit

**Time:** ~15 minutes

### Method 3: Selective (Targeted)
**Best for:** Creating specific high-priority issues first

1. Edit `create-issues-from-todos.sh`
2. Comment out unwanted issues
3. Run the script

**Time:** ~2 minutes
