title: "Implement Async Zone Loading with Thread Safety"

## Description
Implement asynchronous zone loading to prevent frame drops during zone transitions, with proper thread safety considerations.

## Current State
- Zone loading is synchronous
- Large zones may cause frame drops during load
- No thread safety considerations

## Requirements
- Load zone data asynchronously
- Show loading screen during zone load
- Handle thread safety for zone data access
- Ensure smooth transition when load completes
- Graceful error handling for failed loads

## Implementation Considerations
- Use CompletableFuture or similar async mechanism
- Protect shared state with proper synchronization
- Consider resource preloading strategy
- Implement progress reporting for large zones

## Context
From zone-tilemap-sequence.md - Future Enhancements and Notes sections.

## Related Components
- ZoneService
- Zone data model
- Asset loading pipeline
- State management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Async zone loading implemented
- [ ] Thread safety verified
- [ ] Loading screen integration
- [ ] Error handling for failed loads
- [ ] Performance improvement measured
- [ ] Tests verify thread safety
