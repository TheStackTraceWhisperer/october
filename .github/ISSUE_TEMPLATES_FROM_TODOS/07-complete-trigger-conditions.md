title: "Complete Implementation of Trigger Condition Types"
labels: ["enhancement", "high-priority", "triggers", "gameplay"]

## Description
Complete the implementation of trigger condition types beyond the current ON_LOAD support.

## Trigger Types to Implement

### ON_ENTER_AREA (Priority)
- Spatial trigger that fires when player enters defined bounds
- Requires collision detection or position checking
- Should support rectangular or polygonal areas
- Consider performance implications of checking multiple area triggers

### ON_INTERACT (Priority)
- Fires when player interacts with an entity or area
- Requires input handling integration
- Should support different interaction types (use/examine/talk)

### Additional Trigger Types (Optional)
- ON_EXIT_AREA: Fires when leaving an area
- ON_TIMER: Fires after elapsed time in zone
- ON_CONDITION: Fires when arbitrary game state condition is met

## Context
From zone-tilemap-sequence.md - Future Enhancements section.

## Related Components
- TriggerSystem
- Trigger data model
- CollisionSystem (for spatial triggers)
- Input handling system (for interaction triggers)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ON_ENTER_AREA implemented and tested
- [ ] ON_INTERACT implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration tests verify trigger firing
- [ ] Documentation updated with trigger types
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with multiple triggers
