title: "Implement Collision Detection Using Tilemap Properties"
labels: ["enhancement", "high-priority", "collision", "tilemap"]
---

## Description
Use tilemap properties to drive the collision detection system, enabling level geometry to be defined in tilemap data.

## Requirements
- Read collision properties from tilemap tiles
- Integrate collision data with CollisionSystem
- Support different collision types (solid, one-way, etc.)
- Optimize collision checks for performance
- Handle dynamic tilemap changes if needed

## Collision Property Examples
- Solid tiles block all movement
- One-way platforms (vertical only)
- Slopes and ramps
- Trigger areas
- Different collision layers

## Context
From zone-tilemap-sequence.md - Future Enhancements section.

## Related Components
- CollisionSystem
- Tilemap data model
- Zone loading

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Collision properties read from tilemap
- [ ] CollisionSystem uses tilemap collision data
- [ ] Different collision types supported
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Tests verify collision behavior
- [ ] Documentation explains collision property format
