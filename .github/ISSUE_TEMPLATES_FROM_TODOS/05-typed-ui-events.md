title: "Consider Switching UI Events to Typed Event Classes"
labels: ["enhancement", "low-priority", "polish", "ui"]
---

## Description
Evaluate and potentially implement a switch from string-based UI events to typed event classes for better type safety and refactoring support.

## Current State
- UI button events use string identifiers (e.g., "START_NEW_GAME")
- Event listeners match on string values

## Proposed Improvement
- Use typed event classes for UI events
- Improve compile-time type safety
- Better IDE support for refactoring
- Reduced risk of typos

## Context
From integration-todos.md - Low Priority/Polish item.

## Trade-offs to Consider
- Increased complexity vs. type safety benefits
- Impact on serialization/deserialization
- Migration effort for existing UI definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Evaluate pros/cons of typed events
- [ ] If proceeding: Design typed event system
- [ ] If proceeding: Migrate existing UI events
- [ ] If proceeding: Update documentation
- [ ] If proceeding: Tests verify functionality
