## Description
Choose and implement a collision strategy for tilemap interactions.

## Options to Consider
1. **Static Collider Generation**: Generate static colliders at zone load time
2. **Query-based Collision**: Perform collision checks in CollisionSystem by querying tilemap data

## Requirements
- Decide on the collision strategy based on performance and flexibility needs
- Implement the chosen strategy
- Integrate with existing CollisionSystem
- Support collision properties from tilemap data

## Context
From integration-todos.md - High Priority item.

## Related Components
- CollisionSystem
- ZoneService
- Tilemap data model

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Collision strategy is chosen and documented
- [ ] Implementation is complete and integrated
- [ ] Collision detection works correctly with tilemap
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Tests verify collision behavior
